# Project Overview

MyReads: A Book Tracking App is a React.js app which allows to add books and move them into different shelves, depending on the user action.
There are 3 shelves available, corresponding to different labels: 

* Currently Reading
* Want To Read
* Read

Each book comes with a drop-down menu which contains the shelves. Clicking on the desired option moves the book to the corresponding shelf. There is also a fourth option, "none", which simply removes the book from the page.
